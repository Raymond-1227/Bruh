# Raymond's Site

I'll be starting to do the transition between v2 and v3. While I'm moving on to v3, the v2 edition will stay alive until some further ideas.

---

## Versions

**v1**: Jekyll Templates, based on GitHub Pages and it's only a page with useless informations.

**v2**: VuePress Documentation, based on GitLab Pages, but with a lot of informations.

**v3**: Brizy, simplified the v2 by moving all project READMEs back to its own repository, it's only a page too.


## About v2

I found out that my website seemed not working in GitHub, instead of it I hosted on GitLab with the help by [@AdminRAT](https://github.com/AdminRAT).

**v2 Project Link**: [raymond-1227.gitlab.io](https://gitlab.com/raymond-1227/raymond-1227.gitlab.io)
